# TartanVO: A Generalizable Learning-based VO

TartanVO is a learning-based visual odometry trained on [TartanAir](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset) dataset. It generalizes to multiple datasets and real-world scenarios, and outperforms geometry-based methods in challenging scenes. You can check the [python3](https://github.com/castacks/tartanvo/tree/python3) branch if you are using python3.  

Please check out our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00359). 

## Example

Our model is trained purely on simulation data, but it generalizes well to real-world data. For example, these are the testing results on [KITTI-10](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) and [EuRoC V102](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets):

## Setting up the environment in the docker
We provide a prebuilt [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/amigoshan/tartanvo) and a [dockerfile](docker/tartanvo_ros.dockerfile), which allow you to replicate our setup. The docker image contains everything we need for testing this repo, including cuda, pytorch, cupy, opencv, ROS-melodic and etc. Here are the steps to build the docker image. 

1. Install docker and nvidia-docker. You can find online tutorials like [this](https://cnvrg.io/how-to-setup-docker-and-nvidia-docker-2-0-on-ubuntu-18-04/).
2. Run the docker image and mount the repository into the container, the following commands will automatically download the docker image. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/castacks/tartanvo.git
$ cd tartanvo
$ nvidia-docker run -it --rm --network host --ipc=host -v $PWD:/tartanvo amigoshan/tartanvo:latest
$ cd tartanvo
```
3. Now it's all set. Continuing the following steps inside the container.

The above docker image is built on a ubuntu machine with nvidia driver 440.100. Alternatively, you can also build the docker image from the dockerfile we provided:
```
$ cd docker 
$ docker build -t tartanvo -f tartanvo_ros.dockerfile .
```

### Running without docker
This repo has the following dependencies:
* Python 2 / 3
* numpy 
* matplotlib
* scipy
* pytorch >= 1.3
* opencv-python
* cupy

You can install the above dependencies manually, or use the following command:
```
$ pip install numpy matplotlib scipy torch==1.4.0 opencv-python==4.2.0.32 cupy==6.7.0
```

Our code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04. An nvidia-driver and a Cuda version of 9.2/10.2 are required to run the code. 


## Testing with a pretrained model
### Download the pretrained model

```
$ mkdir models
$ wget https://cmu.box.com/shared/static/t1a5u4x6dxohl89104dyrsiz42mvq2sz.pkl -O models/tartanvo_1914.pkl
```

### Download the testing data
  
* Download KITTI-10 testing trajectory
```
$ mkdir data
$ wget https://cmu.box.com/shared/static/nw3bi7x5vng2xy296ndxt19uozpk64jq.zip -O data/KITTI_10.zip
$ unzip -q data/KITTI_10.zip -d data/KITTI_10/
```
You can also download other trajectories from the [KITTI website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php). First, each trajectory may have different intrinsics, make sure you change the values in `Datasets/utils.py`. Second, we are using the same format of pose file with the TartanAir dataset. You can use the `Datasets/transformation/kitti2tartan()` to convert the KITTI pose files. 

* Download EuRoC-V102 testing trajectory
```
$ mkdir data
$ wget https://cmu.box.com/shared/static/1ctocidptdv1xev6pjxdj0b782mrstps.zip -O data/EuRoC_V102.zip
$ unzip -q data/EuRoC_V102.zip -d data/EuRoC_V102/
```
You can download other trajectories from the [EuRoC dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). What we did for the sample data EuRoC_V102 was the following:
- Undistort the image according to their calibration results.
- Match the images with the GT poses according to the timestamp.
- Change the intrinsics parameters in the code. 

Note the poses outputed by TartanVO are in the NED frame. 

### Alternative download links:
In case using the above links is slow, please try the following links from Azure. You can replace the links with the following ones. Instead of `wget`, using the [azcopy tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) usually is much faster.

### Run the testing script
The `vo_trajectory_from_folder.py` script shows an example of running TartanVO on a sequence of images out of a folder. Because TartanVO outputs up-to-scale translation, the script also reads a pose file for adjusting the translation scale. If the pose file is not provided, the default scale of 1.0 will be used. The results are stored in the `results` folder. 

- Testing on KITTI
```
$ python vo_trajectory_from_folder.py  --model-name tartanvo_1914.pkl \
                                       --kitti \
                                       --batch-size 1 --worker-num 1 \
                                       --test-dir data/KITTI_10/image_left \
                                       --pose-file data/KITTI_10/pose_left.txt 
```
- Testing on EuRoC
```

$ python vo_trajectory_from_folder.py  --model-name tartanvo_1914.pkl \
                                       --euroc \
                                       --batch-size 1 --worker-num 1 \
                                       --test-dir data/EuRoC_V102/image_left \
                                       --pose-file data/EuRoC_V102/pose_left.txt
```

<!-- - Testing on TartanAir -->

Running the above commands with the `--save-flow` tag, allows you to save intermediate optical flow outputs into the `results` folder. 

Adjust the batch size and the worker number by `--batch-size 10`, `--worker-num 5`. 

## Run the ROS node 

We provide a python ROS node in `tartanvo_node.py` for the easy integration of the TartanVO into robotic systems. 

### How does TartanVONode work?
1. Subscribed topics
   - rgb_image (sensor_msgs/Image): RGB image.
   - cam_info (sensor_msgs/CameraInfo): camera parameters which are used to calculate intrinsics layer. 
   - vo_scale (std_msgs/Float32): scale of the translation (should be published at the same frequncy with the image). If this is not provided, default value of 1.0 will be used. 

2. Published topics
   - tartanvo_pose (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped): position and orientation of the camera
   - tartanvo_odom (nav_msgs/Odometry): position and orientation of the camera (same with the `tartanvo_pose`).

3. Parameters: 
   We use the following parameters to calculate the initial intrinsics layer. If the `cam_info` topic is received, the intrinsics value will be over-written. 
   - image_width : image width
   - image_height : image height
   - focal_x : camera focal lengh
   - focal_y : camera focal lengh
   - center_x : camera optical center
   - center_y : camera optical center

### Run the ROS node
1. Open a ROS core:
```
$ roscore
```

2. Run the TartanVONode
```
$ python tartanvo_node.py
```

3. Publish the images and scales, e.g. run the following example
```
$ python publish_image_from_folder.py
```

If you open the `rviz` and use this [config file](config.rviz), you can see the visualization as follows
